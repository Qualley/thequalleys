                <h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
                <p>We want to start off by saying how excited we are to be celebrating our marriage with all of our
                    friends and
                    family. We canâ€™t thank you enough for all of the love and
                    support you have shown us over the years. We hope
                    to see you all there!</p>

                <h1>Updates Moving Forward</h1>
                <p>We will be planning on an outdoor ceremony, weather permitting so please dress for possible cold temperatures.</p>
                <h3>Covid 19 Procedures</h3>
                <p>Our venue has been working closely with Jefferson County to ensure events are as safe as possible. We will be providing
                masks and hand sanitizers for those who wish to use them. All windows and doors will be opened and we have kept our
                guest list under the facility capacity to allow for social distancing.<br><br>

                While Colorado has a state-wide mask mandate, our venue is considered private property so guests have the choice on
                whether they would like to wear a mask or not based on their own comfort levels.<br><br>

                We love each and every one of you deeply and want to ensure that everyone stays safe and healthy. Therefore, we ask that
                if you have been exposed or are not feeling well to please let us know and celebrate with us another time.<br><br>

                We appreciate everyone and we look forward to seeing everybody
